<p>It would be quite slow if we naively try to display Liberty Counts for the entire board.
  Each stone would need to run Flood Fill,
  which would then visit every stone and Liberty associated with the stone's chain.
  For long chains this redunancy would be very time consuming.</p>
<p>We need a way to identify which chain each stone belongs to.
  We can store information related to a chain as metadata once it has been calculated.
  Whenever the metadata is required it can be retrieved by the "chain id".
  This will also be of value later when we simulate entire games.
  The metadata for a chain remains unchanged until another stone is placed next to it.</p>
<p>Let's assign chain ids to each stone in <code>board7x7.txt</code>.
  Stones that are connected and of the same colour will share the same "chain id".
  Unconnected stones or adjacent stones of different colour need unique ids.
  The chain ids must not be re-used for other chains.
  We also won't be assigning chain ids to empty spots.</p>
