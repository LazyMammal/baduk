    <p>This page intends to demonstrate a series of small steps that all together will reach a more distant goal.</p>
    <p>Writing a large program can be a daunting task. Even if the end goal is clearly envisioned, the steps to get
      there might be only somewhat understood in advance. Many times the path forward must be discovered one step at a
      time.</p>
    <p>I have the goal of writing a <i>reasonably</i> performing Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) bot for playing the Game
      of Go. I'm going to write it all in JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In order to avoid burnout along the way, I will be dividing up the large size task into many small steps. Each of
      the sections below will focus on one of those small steps.</p>
    <p>This page is a <i>living document</i> and will be updated as I write more sections ...</p>

    <section>
      <h2 id="TheVisionAhead"><a href="#TheVisionAhead">The Vision Ahead</a></h2>
      <p>I want to pick a medium sized goal to directly plan towards. I know that an MCTS bot will need to enact the
        <i>rules of the game</i> in order to perform automated Rollouts. It will also need a way to score a finished game
        for counting wins and losses.
      </p>
      <p>The file <code>liberty_score.txt</code> contains my vision for the minimum abilities a computer would need to
        enforce the rules of Go.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Count Liberties</li>
        <li>Score a Finished Board</li>
      </ol>

        <pre preload-code="liberty_score.txt"></pre>
        <figcaption>liberty_score.txt</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>The text file is written so a human can read it. It's also carefully formatted so it can be read into a
        script and parsed into a set of Unit Tests.</p>
      <p>The next section will start on the path to loading, parsing and <i>eventually</i> executing the Unit Tests in this file.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 id="TheFirstStep"><a href="#TheFirstStep">The First Step</a></h2>
      <p>Before we tackle <code>liberty_score.txt</code> let's start with something less complicated. The first step is reading a text file with an example position from a 5x5 board. It will be easier to parse because it only has a single board, no whitespace, headers, or comments. The overall structure of <code>board.txt</code> is as simple as we can make it while still being a meaningful first step.</p>
